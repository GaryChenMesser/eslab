* This is the repository for the assignments for Embedded System in 2017 fall.  
* Two assignments are in this repository, one is in folder BLE while the other in I2C.

# File Description 
## BLE
The goal of this assignment is to establish a BLE service with C, python, or Node.js and transfer data between the central and the peripheral.  We choose the use Node.js because there are two powerful libraries: bleno and noble, which can act as peripheral and central respectively.  We set up the service to transfer the real time acceleration read from adxl-345(which is a 3-axis accelerometer) on the peripheral to the central.

### central

#### central_acc
